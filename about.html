		<h2>A little bit about me:</h2>
		<p id="bigtext">Hi all, <br>
			<br>
			After graduating from New York University two years ago with a major in Marketing, Management, and Communications, I worked as a Marketing and Operations Analyst at RumbaTime for a little under two years, and also worked as a real estate agent on the side during weekends. About a year ago, I left my job in New York to live in Korea temporarily due to a number of personal reasons. During my stay in Korea, I invested most of my time working on the family business in addition to pursuing my interest in video production by working as a Video Production fellow at Korea's largest broadcasting network. Now that I'm back in New York, I decided it would be an opportune time for me to pick up coding, so I could achieve my dream of ultimately working at a big tech company I would love to be a part of some day.</p>
